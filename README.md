# Robust Text Reading in Natural Scene Images
The problem involves detection of text regions and recognition of the extracted text in natural scene images. Retrieval of text from scene images is a quite challenging task. The first step is isolation of the textual regions in an image. The detected text is then fed into a recognition system which gives the textual information as output. Finally, we get an end-to-end text recognition system for natural scene images.
